# sin-cassie-rl

This work is based on https://github.com/osudrl/cassie-mujoco-sim and https://github.com/ZhaomingXie/cassie_rl_env

mujoco210 is required and should be placed in ~/.mujoco 
If you are not using ubuntu18.04 you should compile libcassiemujoco.so as in https://github.com/osudrl/cassie-mujoco-sim and move it to cassie_m
